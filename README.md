# Movie-and-Book-Recommendation-System

## **Overview**  
This project is a hybrid recommendation system designed to provide personalized recommendations for movies and books. By integrating **Matrix Factorization techniques** such as **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** and **Alternating Least Squares (ALS)** with **collaborative filtering** and **content-based filtering**, the system ensures accurate and diverse recommendations tailored to user preferences.  

The platform also supports advanced filtering by **genre**, **language**, and **release year**, making it user-friendly and versatile. It addresses common challenges like the **cold-start problem** (new users/items) and **data sparsity** through innovative hybrid methods and **dimensionality reduction techniques**.

## **Key Features**  
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering for enhanced accuracy and diversity.  
- **Matrix Factorization**: Implements SVD and ALS for efficient recommendation generation.  
- **Advanced Filtering Options**: Users can filter results by genres, language, and release year.  
- **Cold-Start Problem Solution**: Utilizes hybrid approaches to recommend items for new users or items with limited data.  
- **Data Sparsity Handling**: Overcomes the challenge of sparse datasets through dimensionality reduction.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: High performance demonstrated through **precision**, **recall**, and **coverage** metrics.

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Python**: For building the recommendation algorithms.  
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.  
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing machine learning models and metrics.  
- **Matrix Factorization**: Techniques like SVD and ALS.  
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Textual and metadata-based analysis.  
- **Collaborative Filtering**: User-item interaction data for personalized suggestions.  
- **Data Visualization**: Libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for insights and analysis.

## **Challenges Addressed**  
1. **Cold-Start Problem**: Integrated content-based features (metadata like genres, language) to recommend new items.  
2. **Data Sparsity**: Dimensionality reduction and hybrid methods for better handling of sparse datasets.  
3. **Scalability**: Optimized algorithms for large-scale datasets.  

---

## **Future Enhancements**  
- **Real-Time Updates**: Implementing streaming or online learning to update recommendations dynamically.  
- **Deep Learning Integration**: Adding advanced models like **Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)** or **Autoencoders** for improved accuracy.  
- **Cross-Domain Recommendations**: Enhancing the system to provide recommendations across movies and books.

## **How to Run**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-book-recommendation.git
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
3. Run the script to train and test the model:  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```  
4. View results or recommendations based on sample datasets provided.

## **Dataset**  
This system works with publicly available datasets for movies and books, including:  
- **Movies**: TMDB dataset for user-movie interaction data.  
- **Books**: Goodreads datasets with metadata and ratings.

## **Results**
The system achieves high precision and recall metrics, ensuring that users receive relevant and diverse recommendations. It also provides detailed insights into user preferences, item popularity, and genre-specific trends.
